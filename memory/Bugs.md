## BUG-021: Splash explosion invisible / freezes after typewriter

**Status:** Fixed v2.17.27 — awaiting verification

**Symptoms:**
- Mobile PWA: star doesn't explode, task list loads directly (app recovers via 2s fallback)
- Desktop PWA: star doesn't explode (same fallback recovery)
- Desktop PWA: animation freezes after typewriter completes, requires page refresh (no recovery)

**Root cause 1 — explosion invisible (retina devices):** `sctx.scale(dpr, dpr)` was called inside `sResize()`, which fires on every `resize` event. `scale()` multiplies the existing transform — so after first resize the context ran at `dpr²` scale, corrupting all particle coordinates. On mobile PWA launch, a resize almost always fires (viewport settling, keyboard), so the explosion always drew at the wrong position. On a 3× phone, particles compressed into the top-left corner of the screen — invisible. Introduced in v2.17.19 when DPR-aware canvas was added.

**Fix:** Replaced `sctx.scale(dpr, dpr)` with `sctx.setTransform(dpr, 0, 0, dpr, 0, 0)` in `sResize()`. `setTransform` resets to exactly `dpr×` each call regardless of prior state.

**Root cause 2 — freeze after typewriter:** The two-flag splash gate (`_splashAnimDone` + `_appLoadDone`) has no top-level timeout. `_onAppLoadDone` fires inside an async load chain that includes `await _dropboxEnsureToken()`. If that network request hangs with no timeout (possible on desktop PWA when OS network stack isn't ready), the chain stalls indefinitely. `_appLoadDone` is never set, splash never dismisses. No recovery — user must refresh.

**Fix:** Added a 6-second safety timeout after the gate definitions: calls `_onAppLoadDone` if it hasn't fired yet, so a stalled fetch degrades gracefully instead of freezing.

**Verify:**
- Open app fresh (splash shows) on mobile PWA → star should explode visibly
- Open app fresh on desktop PWA → star should explode visibly
- On slow/flaky network, splash should still dismiss within ~6s even if Dropbox stalls

**Verified fixed:** ☐

## BUG-020: Streak double-counts across devices

**Status:** Fixed v2.17.26 — awaiting verification

**Symptom:** Streak was 108 on Friday. Opened app on Device A Saturday → 109. Opened on Device B Saturday → jumped to 110.

**Root cause:** `stat_streak` was merged with `Math.max` but had no date guard (unlike `stat_focus_mins_today` which has `stat_focus_mins_date`). If Device B received streak=109 via background sync from Device A's Saturday backup, then on first open `checkNewDay()` saw `lastVisit = Friday = yesterday` → incremented 109→110. Same calendar day counted twice across devices.

**Fix (v2.17.26):**
1. Added `stat_streak_date` (YYYY-MM-DD local) — set whenever streak is incremented in `checkNewDay()`.
2. `checkNewDay()` now skips the increment if `stat_streak_date === todayISO` — prevents double-count when another device already bumped the streak today.
3. Merge adopts the lexicographically newer `stat_streak_date` from remote alongside `Math.max` streak — so Device B receives today's date and won't re-increment.
4. Full restore (Connections panel) also restores `stat_streak_date`.
5. Backup payload includes `stat_streak_date`.

**Verify:** Open app on Device A → note streak. Open app on Device B same day → streak should match Device A, not be +1 higher.

**Verified fixed:** ☐

## BUG-011: PiP ghost chime on wrong task

**Status:** Fixed v2.13.5 + v2.13.6 + v2.16.9 — awaiting verification

**Symptom:** Task A → PiP → restore → check Task A → start Task B focus → chime fires during Task B's session.

**Root cause (v2.16.9):** `startPiPClock` captured `uiTaskId` by reference (closure). With BUG-014 fix keeping PiP alive, old RAF from Task A still ran. When its reference point hit zero, it called `completeFor(uiTaskId)` — but `uiTaskId` had changed to Task B.

**Fix (v2.16.9):**
1. `clockTaskId = uiTaskId` captured by value at clock start
2. RAF stops if `uiTaskId !== clockTaskId`
3. Reused PiP path calls `startPiPClock()` for current task

**Verify:** Task A → PiP → restore app → check Task A → start Task B → chime should NOT fire during Task B unless Task B's 25min completes.

**Verified fixed:** ☐

## BUG-012: Overdue Trello card disappears on check / shows undone cross-device

**Status:** Fixed v2.14.5 + v2.16.5 — awaiting verification

**Symptom 1:** Check overdue Trello card → it disappears immediately before midnight.
**Symptom 2:** Check overdue card on Device A → Device B shows it unchecked.

**Root cause (original):** Race between `loadTrello()` and Dropbox sync — stale `doneIds` when filter ran.

**Root cause (Symptom 1):** Filter said `done + overdue = hide` without checking WHEN it was done.

**Fix (v2.14.5):** `mergeRemoteData` re-filters after updating `doneIds`.
**Fix (v2.16.5):** Both `loadTrello` filter and `mergeRemoteData` eviction check `today_checked_ids` timestamp — overdue + done + checked today → show until EOD. Only evict if checked before today.

**Verify:** Check an overdue Trello card → should stay visible (done styling) until midnight. Other device → should clear within 7s without manual refresh.

**Verified fixed:** ☐
