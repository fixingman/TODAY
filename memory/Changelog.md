# TODAY — Changelog

| Version | Key change |
|---|---|
| **2.11.3** | **Critical bug fix** — Missing `_escapeHtml` (renamed to `esc`) and `_getAgeDays` functions caused app freeze at splash and triage failure. |
| **2.11.2** | **Mobile keyboard fix** — Input bar stays visible above keyboard (visualViewport API). Black fill below bar when not focused. |
| **2.11.1** | **Zones Dropbox sync** — SOON/PAST now sync cross-device (schema v5.0). Union merge by task ID, newer `zoneChangedAt` wins. PAST capped at 100 items. |
| **2.11.0** | **Zones + Flow fix** — SOON/PAST sections (collapsed). Per-task evening triage after 8pm. Flow rate fixed: `done / total` visible tasks. PiP: delay before open, reopens on every minimize. |
| **2.10.0** | **Idle companion** — After 45s of inactivity, a random ASCII creature appears (dino, fish, bird, cat, snail, crab, or star). DM Mono, accent glow. Inspired by cli-spinners. Pure delight. |
| **2.9.9** | **All-done reward** — Finishing feels felt. Accent glow pulse, extra particle burst, double haptic, and variable warm AI messages: "8 tasks cleared. Impressive." Not gamification — just acknowledgment. |
| **2.9.8** | **Energy rhythm awareness** — AI considers peak hour when suggesting tasks. Pre-peak: "start light". Peak time: "good moment for deep work". Post-peak: "wind down with quick ones". No lecture, just smarter suggestions. |
| **2.9.7** | **Focus time formatting** — Shows "1h 25m" when >= 60 minutes, "45m" otherwise. Cleaner stats display. Applied to info panel and weekly reflection. |
| **2.9.6** | **Empty state invitation** — AI invites warmly when list is empty. Pattern-aware prompts: "Day 5. What's on your mind?" vs generic "Add a task". The void becomes an invitation. |
| **2.9.5** | **Memory speaks** — AI proactively notices patterns from memory: streak records, peak hour awareness, focus milestones, recent wins. Probabilistic with 24h cooldown per observation type. The companion observes without being asked. |
| **2.9.4** | **AI awareness** — Morning briefing (first open), stale task noticing (3+ days: "still relevant?"), Sunday evening reflection. AI acts as a companion that observes patterns. New `delete_task` action for "let it go". |
| **2.9.3** | **Visual aging** — tasks gradually fade as they age (75% at day 3-4, 55% at 5-6, 35% at 7+). Acknowledgment without action. Hover restores readability. Pomodoro resets age. |
| **2.9.2** | **Visual tags** — tasks starting with `tag: ` render the tag as muted uppercase prefix. Pure styling — no filtering, no grouping, no tag management. Pattern: 1-12 alphanumeric chars + `: `. |
| **2.9.1** | **Fix: habit sync** — edits (name changes, new habits, completions, reorder) now trigger Dropbox sync. Previously only saved to localStorage. |
| **2.9.0** | **Flow rate simplified** — now calculated live as `done / added × 100%` for today only. Resets daily. No more exponential smoothing or accumulated values >100%. Matches clean slate philosophy. |
| **2.8.9** | **PiP improvements** — Open button to return to main app from widget. iOS keyboard positioning fix (visualViewport.offsetTop). |
| **2.8.8** | **Critical fix: sync broken** — missing `localIds` variable in `mergeRemoteData()` caused silent ReferenceError. Also: immediate sync on page load (always pull→merge→push), PiP reopens on second tab leave, star button size increased, tooltip shows AI name. |
| **2.8.7** | **Bug fixes + Motion audit** — Undo toast clickable (z-index fix). Focus mode: edge nudge only if task clipped by header/footer. Motion tokens: added `--ease-spring`, aligned transitions to duration tokens. |
| **2.8.6** | **Mobile fixes + Stats sync** — Input bar stays above keyboard (visualViewport API). ✦ button single star on mobile. Stats sync across devices (focus mins, streak, flow rate). Focus time tracks actual minutes spent, not just completed sessions. |
| **2.8.5** | **Picture-in-Picture focus widget** — auto-opens when leaving tab during focus mode, auto-closes on return. Shows task name + progress bar + time. Hover reveals Breathe/Rest controls. Chrome/Edge 116+, Firefox 148+ (behind flag). |
| **2.4.0** | **Dashboard simplified** — 3 metrics only: Completed, Streak, Flow. Flow rate uses exponential smoothing (`rate × 0.85 + today × 0.15`) — rewards consistency, recent days matter more. |
| 2.3.6 | Animation simplification — `taskSlideIn` → pure fade (no transform), ✦ button → subtle opacity pulse (removed width expansion), splash → faster/tighter timing. Removed shadow-divider from mobile bar. |
| 2.3.5 | Accessibility: `prefers-reduced-motion` support — disables breathing animations, reduces transitions for users who prefer reduced motion. |
| 2.3.4 | Fade gradients on sticky header and add-task bar — content softens before clipping under chrome. |
| 2.3.3 | Motion refinement: breathing animations on proactive CTA button (`gentleBreath`) and "All done" star (`starBreath`). Motion Philosophy documented in Design.md. |
| **2.3.2** | **Token audit** — `--z-header`, `--accent-hover`, `--shadow-float`, `--shadow-divider` added. All hardcoded rgba/z-index replaced with tokens. `#trelloSection` padding-top for header clearance. |
| 2.3.1 | Proactive suggestion copy: "Nice — tidy up?" / "✦ All done" with "Tidy" / "Start fresh" buttons |
| **2.3.0** | **AI proactive suggestions** — after checking off ≥3 tasks, offers to clear done tasks. No API call, pure client-side. Auto-dismisses 12s, once per session. |
| **2.2.16** | **First interaction freeze fix** — defer heavy sync work with setTimeout(0) to yield to event loop after paint. App now responds instantly. |
| 2.2.15 | Fix intermittent null style error in splash animation — add guards for logo/dateWrap/splash/mainApp |
| 2.2.14 | Mobile drag fix: disable text selection on manual tasks (pointer:coarse) for smoother drag gestures |

| 2.2.8 | AI config UX: Connect button disabled until input, label layout fixed, connected state inline |
| 2.2.7 | Bottom bar stroke removed (cleaner visual) |
| 2.2.6 | Header polish: remove shadow and bottom padding, progress bar flush at bottom |
| 2.2.5 | Copy revision: tonality applied throughout — "Get tasks", "Forget", "Save", "Bring back", "One moment…" |
| **2.2.4** | **Tonality** — Focus mode hints now say "breathe" / "rest". Tonality guidelines added to Design.md §2. Human language for humans, not robots. |
| 2.2.3 | Focus mode: Esc closes UI without resetting timer (keeps running in background) |
| 2.2.2 | Focus mode: kbd hint appears below timer bar, not fixed at bottom (avoids overlap with add-task bar) |
| 2.2.1 | Focus mode: click blinking timer bar to restart pomodoro (cursor:pointer on complete state) |
| **2.2.0** | **AI Post-Add Enhancement** — after adding a task, AI analyzes in background and offers to break down complex tasks into 2-3 subtasks. Non-blocking, auto-dismisses after 10s. |
| 2.1.3 | AI config: explicit hasKey check to prevent false "connected" state |
| 2.1.2 | Fix `_todayStr is not defined` — use `_habitTodayISO()` instead |
